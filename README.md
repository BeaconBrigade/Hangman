# Hangman

> A simple hangman game made with Python

Found the inspiration from a YouTube video talking about the few beginner Python programs one could try, which mentioned hangman in it, so I decided to make a super simple version of it...

## Features

- A whooping 50 animal names to guess from!
- Will call you trash if you fail to guess the word
- Shows hangman progressively getting hanged with each failed attempt

## Features to be added

- Even more words to guess from
- An better interface, maybe?

## Contribution

- Any contribution is highly appreciated. Please feel free to fork it! :)
