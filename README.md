# Hangman

Coded my own cli based hangman game

- Found the inspiration from a youtube vid talking about the few beginner python programs one could try, mentioned hangman in it. Sooo, thought to make it..
- Did it before i knew to work with functions and classes and stuff.

## Features

- A whooping 20 animal names to guess from!!!!! (lol)
- calls u trash if u fail to guess the word
- shows hangman progressively getting hanged with each failed attempt
- and idk
